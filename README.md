# What is DawnLang?  
DawnLang (Dawn for short) is a programming language!   
# Why is it called DawnLang?  
The creator of DawnLang one afternoon was about to play Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Soulstorm, and then suddenly had the idea to make a programming language, and while racking up their brain for a name, decided upon DawnLang.  
# Standard Library  
The files for the standard library of DawnLang can be found <a href="https://github.com/Pyro569/DawnLibs">here</a>  Feel free to add to them and PR if you would like, however before considering that look at the below section.  
# Discontinuation  
Due to the limitations of Python, DawnLang is also severely limited. Due to this, this version of DawnLang is being discontinued and will be put into a maintenance mode with few updates and few standard library updates. Check out the new version of DawnLang that is being recreated in C# <a href="https://github.com/Pyro569/DawnLang-Plus-Plus">here</a>. There are many things that I would like to do differently with this language that C# will allow me to easily do compared to Python.
