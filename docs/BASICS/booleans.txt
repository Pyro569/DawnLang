A boolean is a data type structure that equates to true or false. 
For example, if I have the boolean isWorking and it defaults to false at the beginning of the program, isWorking will have a value of 0, meaning it is false, but once the value is set to true, the value will be 1, signifying true.
Example:
    DawnLang > VAR apples = 12
    12
    DawnLang > apples == 19
    0

    DawnLang > VAR apples == 19
    19
    DawnLang > apples == 19
    1

Breakdown:
    DawnLang > VAR apples = 12 //initialize VAR named apples with a value of 12
    12
    DawnLang > apples == 19 //check if apples is equal to 19
    0 //apples is not equal to 19, print 0 in return

    DawnLang > VAR apples = 19 //initialize VAR named apples with a value of 19
    19
    DawnLang > apples == 19 //check if apples is equal to 19
    1 //apples is equal to 19, print 1 in return
