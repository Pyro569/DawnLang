An IF/DO statement is a special type of statement that allows certain code to be ran only in certain circumstances.
Example:
    DawnLang > VAR apples = 19
    19
    DawnLang > IF apples == 19 DO INT apples = 18 
    18

    DawnLang > VAR apples == 12
    12
    DawnLang > IF apples == 19 DO VAR apples = 18 ELSE VAR apples = 21 
    21

Breakdown:
    DawnLang > VAR apples = 19 //initialize VAR named apples with a value of 19
    19
    DawnLang > IF apples == 19 DO VAR apples = 18 //if apples is equal to 19, then apples is equal to 18
    18

    DawnLang > VAR apples == 12 //initialize VAR named apples with a value of 12
    12
    DawnLang > IF apples == 19 DO VAR apples = 18 ELSE VAR apples = 21 //if apples is equal to 19, then apples is equal to 18, but if apples is not equal to 19, apples is equal to 21
    21
