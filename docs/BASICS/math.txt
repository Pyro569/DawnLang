To do math operations in DawnLang, run the interpreter and just type in any math problem you would like it to solve (minus algebraic equations), the built-in math interpreter will evaluate using order of operations rules and, as you'll see later on, can use orders of operations with variables
Example:
DawnLang > 8 \* 7 - (3 / 2) - 2 + 6
58.5

    DawnLang > 8 / 9
    0.8888888888888888

    DawnLang > 9 - 12 + 3 * 5 / 1
    12.0

Breakdown:
Lets use the second example to breakdown

    DawnLang > 8 / 9 //inputs 8 divided by 9 to the math interpreter
    0.8888888888888888 //interpreter outputs the solution to the answer
