A for loop is a special type of loop that will repeat a process until a certain condition is met.
A while loop is just like a for loop in that it will repeat until a condition is met.

Example:
    DawnLang > INT i = 0
    0
    DawnLang > FOR i = 1 TO 6 DO INT b = i + 1
    DawnLang > b
    6 

    DawnLang > INT i = 0
    0
    DawnLang > WHILE i < 100 DO INT i = i + 1

Breakdown:
    DawnLang > INT i = 0 //initialize a INT named i with value of 0
    0
    DawnLang > FOR i = 1 TO 6 DO INT b = i + 1 //Start at 1, continue until 6 (exclusive), each run of code INT b is set as i + 1
    DawnLang > b
    6
